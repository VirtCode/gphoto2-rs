# libgphoto2_sys

These are raw auto-generated bindings for [libgphoto2](https://github.com/gphoto/libgphoto2).

By default they'll look for a system installation of libgphoto2, but you can manually set the location of a libgpoto2 installation via `LIBGPHOTO2_DIR` environment variable at compile-time.
